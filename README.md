Second graphic project @42 coding school. This time we go a bit deeper, exploring [Fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal).
Goal is to display some known fractals (in this case: Mandelbrot | Julia | Burning ship) and do some cool stuff with them.
That would include zooming, switching fractals from inside the window, and many more. Pictures to come.
